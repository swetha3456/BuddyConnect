# BuddyConnect

## Problem Statement

- It is difficult for adults to make new friends and bond over shared experiences.
- We often hesitate to attend events that we are interested in due to lack of company and the fear of being alone there. 

## The Solution

BuddyConnect is a simple application that helps users find a buddy to attend events with. Users can list an event they are interested in, and others can share their contact details with them if they're interested in joining them for the event.

## Running the Application

1. Install Flask.

    ```bash
    pip install flask
2. Run ```dbfunctions.py``` to create the database. A file named ```database.db``` should be created.

    ```bash
    python3 dbfunctions.py
2. Run ```app.py``` and open the specified port on your browser.

    ```bash
    python3 app.py
