# BuddyConnect

## Problems I Aim to Solve

- It is difficult for adults to make new friends and bond over shared experiences.
- We often hesitate to attend events that we are interested in due to lack of company and the fear of being alone there. 

## The Solution

BuddyConnect is a simple application that helps users find a buddy to attend events with. Users can list an event they are interested in, and others can request to join them. If the user accepts the request, contact details are shared with the new event buddy!
